##The Intel® Deep Learning Framework
The Intel® Deep Learning Framework is a SDK library for Deep Neural Networks  training and execution.
It includes the API that enables building neural network topology as a compute workflow, functions to optimize the graph and execute it on hardware. Our initial focus is neural network driven object classification (ImageNet topology) implemented on CPU (Xeon) and GPU (Gen). The API is designed in the way allowing us to easily support more devices in the future. Our key principle is achieving maximum performance on each supported Intel platform.
