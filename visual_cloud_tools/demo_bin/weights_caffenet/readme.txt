The "weights_caffenet" folder contains weights necessary for proper execution of the Intel® Deep Learning Framework (IDLF) demo application.
These weights were originally obtained from the Caffe Model Zoo project (http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/model_zoo.html) and converted to IDLF internal format. 
Files in this folder are published under the same BVLC model license as their origin from Caffe Model Zoo.
